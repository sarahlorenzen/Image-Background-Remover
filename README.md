## Problem: 
Itâ€™s very time-consuming to manually remove the background of product photos in post processing to prepare the images for use on their website and wholesale marketplace.

## Solution: 
They need an AI-based image removal tool. This will dramatically improve and speed up the product listing creation process. A must feature was batch image processing.

## Implementation: 
I created a web-deployed app that will get their white background product photos to 90% there with minor edits, drastically saving time and effort. With the help of OpenCV and Python library Rembg, I got the tool to consistently perform well on their flat lay e-commerce product photos.

I further iterated on this project to allow batch image processing up to 20MB at a time.
